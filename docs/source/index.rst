Welcome to Stellar Python Client
********************************

Welcome to Stellar Python Client's documentation. If you're new, you can head over to :doc:`installation` to setup your
environment, and then to :doc:`quickstart` for a quick tutorial on how to create a graph from our example dataset and
start using other tools within Stellar. For a more in-depth look into the module, check out the API references and our
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/data61/stellar-py>`_.
